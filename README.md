Simple :dart:, safe :lock:, and powerful :muscle:

This repository is home to both the language documentation and Alta's compiler CLI (command line interface).

*Disclaimer*: This is currently a personal/hobby project (although I would like it to be more, if possible). This is mainly a learning experience for the inner workings of a compiler as well as how common standard library components (e.g. Unicode, JSON, networking, etc.) are implemented.
