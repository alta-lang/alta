Alta
============

A simple, safe, and powerful programming language

*Disclaimer*: This is currently a personal/hobby project (although I would like it to be more, if possible). This is mainly a learning experience for the inner workings of a compiler as well as how certain components of a language (e.g. Unicode support, JSON parsing, etc.) are implemented.

============

This installer will install most of the necessary components to get started with Alta development.

A full install is recommended. This will install the compiler (`altac`), the runtime sources, some utilities (like `amake`), the standard library, and an offline copy of Alta's documentation.
A minimal install is also available. This will install the compiler (`altac`) and the runtime sources.

In addition, a working C compiler is required in order to compile the C code generated by the Alta compiler. This must be installed separately, and is not included as part of this installer. See https://github.com/alta-lang/alta/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md for help on how to install the right compiler for your platform.
