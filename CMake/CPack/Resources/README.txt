A simple, safe, and powerful programming language

*Disclaimer*: This is currently a personal/hobby project (although I would like it to be more, if possible). This is mainly a learning experience for the inner workings of a compiler as well as how certain components of a language (e.g. Unicode support, JSON parsing, etc.) are implemented.

============

This package contains the necessary components to get started with Alta development.

This will install:
  * The compiler (`altac`)
  * The runtime sources
  * Some utilities (like `amake`)
  * The standard library
  * An offline copy of Alta's documentation

Please refer to https://github.com/alta-lang/alta/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md for help with getting started with Alta development.
